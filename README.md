# Palmer-Penguins-Project---PIC16A
Collaborative project from my Python and Computing (PIC 16A) class. 

The goal was to classify penguin species given both qualitative and quantitative variables. I cleaned the data and performed EDA through visualizations with the Plotly package. 

I also researched and implemented SVM models to classify the penguins with over 99% accuracy on unseen data. I used GridSearch to paramerize the model and coded decision regions to visualize its fit.
